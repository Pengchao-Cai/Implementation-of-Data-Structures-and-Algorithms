## Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms

- [Pengchao Cai](https://github.com/Pengchao-Cai) 
  (Spring 2021)
  

#### Topics: 
1. Implementation of data structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Balanced Search Trees, Hashing, Graphs); 
2. Implementation of algorithms (Sorting and searching, Recursion, Graph algorithms).

Emphasizing on practical approach to algorithms with many programming projects of types: 
- Long: Implementation of data structures and algorithms (total 5). Teams of 3-4.
- Short: Empirical studies, Do-and-learn projects. One project (almost) every week. Teams of 2 or individual.

Following is the detailed list of each project:
